# Low Effort Cooking

This is a collection of notes and recipes I've used as I slowly learn to move a
larger portion of my diet to food prepared by and for myself, reducing both
cost and waste.

## Why "Low Effort"?

I have found that I need things to be very convenient to develop habits. You
may find it difficult to follow an average video or recipe because you simply
don't feel the necessary intrinsic motivation strongly enough. The cause could
be as innocent as just being a bit lazy that day or lacking energy or as
serious as chronic executive dysfunction caused by a mental illness or
developmental disorder.

While I can only speak for myself, I hope that this is a helpful resource for
others who have struggled with cooking.

## Contents

This is mostly organized into individual notes, which may be individual recipes
or information about tools and techniques.
