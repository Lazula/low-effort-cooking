# Low Effort Cooking

Jump to the info:
* [Notes](#notes)
* [Recipes](#recipes)

This is a collection of notes and recipes I've used as I slowly learn to move a
larger portion of my diet to food prepared by and for myself, reducing both
cost and waste.

This is a living document. Things will be changed and added over time.

## Why "Low Effort"?

I have found that I need things to be very convenient to develop habits. If
something takes too much effort, I'm far less likely to stick to it. You may
find it difficult to follow an average video or recipe because you simply don't
feel the necessary motivation strongly enough. The cause could be as innocent
as just lacking energy that day or as serious as chronic executive dysfunction
caused by a mental illness or other disorder.

While I can only speak for myself, I hope that this is a helpful resource for
others who have struggled with cooking. I am trying to keep things as simple as
possible while still allowing room for making things your own. I'm almost
embarrassingly clumsy, so it takes a lot of time to do things some consider
easy. If you identify with any of the above statements, I encourage you to read
on.

I hope to show a path to more easily develop the skills and habits needed to
integrate cooking into your daily life. I'm far from an expert, but there are
certainly things I wish I had known when I started. I've learned all this
through simple experimentation - trial and error, keeping what works and
tossing out what doesn't.

## Contents

The information here is organized into individual files, each dedicated to a
single topic, as broad or narrow as it may be. The Recipes section,
unsurprisingly, is simply a collection of recipes. The Notes section contains
any general information, sometimes with links to relevant recipes. I also use
them to collect related recipes in a single place. I prefer doing this while
maintaining a flat file structure instead of simply having subdirectories to
avoid strict categorization.

If you just want the recipes, you can simply browse them as desired. The notes
contain information about cooking, and are recommended if you're having
trouble.
