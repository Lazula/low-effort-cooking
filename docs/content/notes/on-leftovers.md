# On Leftovers

Most recipes that I like are intended to be a single serving, quickly prepared
in a small quantity. I usually prefer to make whatever appeals to me at a given
time - to make something, eat it, clean up, and have a clean slate for next
time. However, I recognize that this is far from universal, and some recipes
will cater to those who would prefer to prepare several meals ahead of time.

Typically, a major ingredient in many recipes can be prepared beforehand and
used throughout (e.g.) a week. "Leftovers", specifically part of a
fully-prepared meal that is finished at a later time, are more difficult to
maintain a high standard of quality with, and if it's unappealing you're less
likely to want to eat it, and you'll probably end up with more food waste.

Some types of food are better suited for leftovers than others. Fresh rice, for
example, if made in a rice cooker can be kept on a "keep warm" setting for
about 3 days before a noticable drop in quality, and used in fried rice to get
even more life out of it. Cooked salmon or other fish can simply be
refrigerated and eaten cold.
