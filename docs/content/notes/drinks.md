# Drinks

I keep a cycling bottle filled with water with me at all times and I drink a
lot of water. However, I typically don't like to have only water when eating.
It tends to cleans your palate, which I don't find desirable during a meal when
I'm taking a drink after each bite. So, I have a few simple drinks that I can
usually either have prepared beforehand or make them during downtime while
making something.
