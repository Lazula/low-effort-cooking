## Thoughts

**[2021-07-15]** I started drinking coffee a few months ago in earnest. I had
various sweet cold coffees and also tried some espresso drinks like mocha and
cappuccino, but this is what I do for an everyday drink. I also like to add a
little cocoa powder to make a non-espresso mocha. I chose to include this
recipe despite there being a lot of personal preference because the French
press method is very easy.
