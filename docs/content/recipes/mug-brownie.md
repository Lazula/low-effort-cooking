To make this recipe vegan, exchange the butter and milk for 2 tbsp coconut oil
and 3 tbsp of your preferred nondairy milk.

## Instructions

1. Mix dry ingredients in a mug or bowl.
2. Add liquids and mix well. Ensure that no powder remains at the bottom.
3. Microwave for 90 seconds.

## Thoughts

**[2021-07-15]** I've used this a lot recently. It's very straightforward to
prepare. The only downside is that melting the butter in the microwave can
create a very strong scent.
