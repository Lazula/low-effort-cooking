# Rice Pudding

Quick and easy to make with equal parts fresh or leftover cooked rice and milk,
plus some sugar, this pudding is a good alternative to breakfast cereal if you
still want something sweet to start your day.

## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup rice, cooked
* 1/2 cup milk
* 1/8 cup sugar
* 1 pinch salt

## Instructions

1. Place the rice, milk, and sugar in a saucepan. If the rice has large clumps,
   break it up.
2. Stir lightly and add the salt.
3. Turn on the stovetop to medium heat.
4. Stir frequently for about 15 minutes or until the pudding reaches the
   desired consistency. Stirring can be done less frequently early on, but
   needs to be kept up as the pudding nears completion to prevent uneven
   cooking, similar to scrambled eggs.
5. Add any desired toppings before serving, such as brown sugar, cinnamon, or
   fruit.
