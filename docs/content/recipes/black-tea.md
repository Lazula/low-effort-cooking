# Black Tea

## Ingredients

* 1 tea bag
* 1 cup water

## Instructions

1. Heat the water, either in the microwave on high for 70 seconds in a
   measuring cup, in a kettle, or by your preferred means.
2. Place the tea bag in a cup and pour the water over it.
3. Let the tea steep for 4 minutes.
4. Remove and toss the tea bag.
5. Sweeten to taste.

You can make as many servings of this as you want in a vessel, keeping the same
ratio of 1 tea bag to 1 cup of water.

## Thoughts

**[2021-07-15]** I've always bought sweet tea at the grocery store. It's cheap,
right? Well, yes. Tea is one of the least expensive beverages you can buy. It's
still more expensive than just using tea bags. Cost isn't the only factor,
though. You can make it just as sweet as you want it, and make however much you
want at a time. A single small $5 box of 100 tea bags can make 6 1/4 gallons of
tea, and it's much easier to move and manage than 6 separate gallon containers.
I like to add about 1 tbsp of sugar for hot tea and 1.5 tbsp for cold tea.
