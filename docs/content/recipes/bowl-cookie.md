# Cookie Bowl

Slightly more complicated than the basic [flour and cream
biscuits](flour-and-cream-biscuits.md), this cookie has a few more ingredients
while retaining a simple preparation process.

## Ingredients

* 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
* 1/2 tsp baking powder
* 1 tbsp sugar
* 2 tbsp peanut butter
* 1/4 cup milk
* 2 tbsp chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Mix the flour, baking powder, and sugar in a mug or bowl with a fork.
2. Add the peanut butter and milk, then mix until it looks like batter.
3. Mix in the chocolate chips.
4. Microwave for 90 seconds.

## Thoughts

**[2021-07-15]** I haven't used this recipe in a long time. I ought to try it
again. The bowl was always kind of a pain to clean and measuring peanut butter
is kind of annoying, but it was good.
