# Flour and Cream Biscuits

With only two necessary ingredients, these biscuits are an excellent way to
start baking with no prior experience. The dough can be handled with your bare
hands or with a spatula.

## Ingredients

* 1 1/2 cup self-rising flour
* 3/4 cup heavy cream

The flour and cream should be equal in weight. If you have a kitchen scale,
measure out 6 oz. of each instead.

The flour **must** be self-rising. All-purpose flour will **not** work.

### Optional Additions

* Shortcakes: Add 2 tbsp sugar and 1 tbsp vanilla.
* Blueberry biscuits: Add 1/2 cup of fresh or frozen blueberries.
* Bacon cheddar biscuits: Add 1/2 cup chopped bacon and 3/4 cup chopped cheddar
  cheese.
* Pumpkin spice biscuits: Add 2 tbps sugar and 1 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice.

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 450F.
2. Add flour and cream to bowl. Add any additional powder ingredients before
   mixing.
3. Mix into dough. If the dough does not come together, add more cream. If the
   dough is very wet, add more flour.
4. (Optional) Add any additional solid ingredients.
5. Place baking parchment on a pan. Scoop the dough into balls of the desired
   size. If desired, brush the tops with cream or melted butter.
6. Bake for 10 minutes.
7. Add any desired toppings such as honey or jam.

## Thoughts

**[2021-07-15]** It's been a very long time since I used this recipe. It was
one of the first recipes I started with more than 2 years ago, when I had
essentially no cooking ability at all. It may take a few tries to get the
amounts right if you aren't going by weight. Measuring flour by volume is an
absolute pain and I don't recommend doing it unless you have to.
